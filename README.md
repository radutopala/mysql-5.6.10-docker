# MySQL 5.6.10 Docker Image Builder

## Docker Hub Image

```
radutopala/mysql:5.6.10
```

## Why
`mysql:5.6.10` is not present anymore in Docker Hub, but older production systems still use this MySQL version and it's required to be able to run integration tests against it.

## Note
Based on https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/tree/master/5.6 with the necessary workarounds.
